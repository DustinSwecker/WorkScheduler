# Site to save your daily to-dos

## Wrote JavaScript for Workday Planner to save important to-dos.

Considering that users oftentimes need to plan ahead and save important information for their workdays, a website was created to ease this by allowing the user to save important information inside text boxes which changed color based on the time of the day.



## Installation

N/A

## Usage

The site provides text boxes where text can be saved to local storage and retrieved later. It displays the current date in the top right corner. Additionally, the text boxes change colors based on whether the time they represent exists in the past, present, or future.
